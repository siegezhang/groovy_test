Imagine that a customer needs a memo generator.
 The memos needs to have a few simple fields, such as "to", "from", and "body".
 The memo can also have sections such as "Summary" or "Important."
 The summary fields are dynamic and can be anything on demand.
 In addition, the memo needs to be outputed in three formats: xml, html, and text.
